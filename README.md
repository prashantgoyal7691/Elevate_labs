During my internship training, I worked on hands-on MySQL database exercises to develop a solid understanding of relational database concepts and SQL operations. The training emphasized core principles of database design, data manipulation, and query execution.

I gained practical experience in creating databases and tables, inserting and managing records, and writing SQL queries to retrieve and analyze data. These activities helped me understand how databases are structured and how data is efficiently stored, accessed, and maintained in real-world applications.

This internship strengthened my practical MySQL skills, improved my problem-solving abilities, and prepared me to work confidently with databases in backend development and software projects.
